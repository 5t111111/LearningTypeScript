## Content

---

> **Note:** Not all source code files are free of compilation errors. Some of the examples throw compilation errors to demostrate how the TypeScript language services can detect them.

---

> **Note:** The source code contains internal modules (AKA `namespace`), which are used to isolate each demo from the others. As it is explained in the book contents, in a real-world TypeScript application, it is recommended to avoid the usage of internal modules.
